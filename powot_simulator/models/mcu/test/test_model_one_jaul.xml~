A Powot Simulator energy model for test_model_one_jaul
All timings are in ms, currents in mA, the final energy is divided by DIVISOR
except the DVS/DFS functions. The DVS/DFS functions must be provided directly
with the metrics as the variable METRICS.

Available instruction types:
 mem   - memory access
 datap - data processing
 sat   - saturation instructions
 contr - branch and control
 misc  - miscellaneous

	<!--
	The current/exec.time/voltage when multiplied will produce results in 
	the following metrics (Jaulle):
	-->
	<metrics>uJ</metrics>

	<!--
	Divide the energy results for each instruction by this number for 
	better display
